* Overview
  The codes in this repository contain the codes and data that are required to reproduce the figures in the article: "Network rewiring promotes cooperation in an aspirational learning model"; A Pal, S Sengupta.
  The figures presented in the article have a corresponding folder in this repository.

* Plotting
  *Python files with structure plot_fig.py generate the figures from the data files (.npz format) present in the corresponding folders.*
  The following folders do not have a plot function because only a single realization is required to produce the plots:
  Fig3, Fig4, Fig6, Fig8, Fig9, Fig11
  Thus, to generate the plots for the above figures, run sim_.py*

* Simulating
  *Python files with structure sim_.py inside each folder simulates the model and generates both data files and plots*
